# i18n demo repository with Module Federation

This demo cover 2 scenarios:
- static i18n with @angular/localize
- dynamic with ngx-translate

There are on more scenario when content is localized, 
but this is completely under control of application/module developer
and could not be affected by Module Federation.

Keep in mind CORS limitations.
